We start by loading the required package. **`ggplot2`** is also included in the
**`tidyverse`** package.

The data is available as part of the project you cloned from GitHub during
the previous lesson. Switch to that project now if you haven't opened it
in RStudio already.

## Plotting with **`ggplot2`**

**`ggplot2`** is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots
from data stored in a data frame. It provides a programmatic interface for
specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual
properties. Therefore, we only need minimal changes if the underlying data
change or if we decide to change from a bar plot to a scatterplot. This helps in
creating publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and
tweaking.

**`ggplot2`** functions like data in the 'long' format, i.e., a column for every
dimension, and a row for every observation. Well-structured data will save you
lots of time when making figures with **`ggplot2`**

ggplot graphics are built step by step by adding new elements. Adding layers in
this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots.

To build a ggplot, we will use the following basic template that can be used for different types of plots:

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

- use the `ggplot()` function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using
  the `data` argument


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting)
~~~
{: .language-r}

- define a mapping (using the aesthetic (`aes`) function), by selecting the variables to be plotted
  and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as
  size, shape, color, etc.

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}



~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items))
~~~
{: .language-r}

- add 'geoms' â€“ graphical representations of the data in the plot (points,
lines, bars). **`ggplot2`** offers many different geoms; we will use some
common ones today, including:

* `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
* `geom_boxplot()` for, well, boxplots!
* `geom_line()` for trend lines, time series, etc.

To add a geom to the plot use the `+` operator. To create a scatterplot we
want the data to be represented as points, which can be achieved with `geom_point()`:


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-first-ggplot-1.png" title="plot of chunk first-ggplot" alt="plot of chunk first-ggplot" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The `+` in the **`ggplot2`** package is particularly useful because it allows
you to modify existing `ggplot` objects. This means you can easily set up plot
templates and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above plot
can also be generated with code like this:


~~~
# Assign plot to a variable
interviews_plot <- ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items))

# Draw the plot
interviews_plot +
    geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

> ## Notes
>
> - Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers
>   that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x-
>   and y-axis mapping you set up in `aes()`.

~~~
## This is the correct syntax for adding layers
interviews_plot +
    geom_point()

## This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
interviews_plot
+ geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Building your plots iteratively

Building plots with **`ggplot2`** is typically an iterative process. We start by
defining the dataset we'll use, lay out the axes, and choose a geom:
	

~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-create-ggplot-object-1.png" title="plot of chunk create-ggplot-object" alt="plot of chunk create-ggplot-object" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it.

> ## Exercise

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We can add transparency using the `alpha` option:


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-adding-transparency-1.png" title="plot of chunk adding-transparency" alt="plot of chunk adding-transparency" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

> ## Note
>
> When setting a mapping to a constant (e.g. `alpha = 0.5` above) these
> can be set directly, without requiring a call to `aes()`.
{: .callout}

That only helped a little bit with the overplotting problem. We can also
introduce a little bit of randomness into the position of our points
using the `geom_jitter()` function.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-adding-jitter-1.png" title="plot of chunk adding-jitter" alt="plot of chunk adding-jitter" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That is a bit better but now the points with similar *x* and *y* values are a
bit difficult to distinguish. We can fix that by reducing the amount of horizontal
jitter using the `width` argument.



~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.15, height = 0.15)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-reduce-jitter-1.png" title="plot of chunk reduce-jitter" alt="plot of chunk reduce-jitter" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Now the points for each combination of `no_membrs` and `number_items` form small clusters
that can be distinguished visually. 

After creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favorite format.
The Export tab in the **Plot** pane in RStudio will save your plots at low
resolution, which will not be accepted by many journals and will not scale well for posters.

Instead, use the `ggsave()` function, which allows you easily change the dimension 
and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments (`width`, `height` and `dpi`).
Make sure you have the `fig_output/` folder in your working directory.


~~~
membrs_item_plot <- ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.15, height = 0.15)

ggsave("fig_output/membrs_item.png", membrs_item_plot, width = 15, height = 10)
~~~

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


We can also add colors for all the points:


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.2, size = 3, color = "blue")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-adding-colors-1.png" title="plot of chunk adding-colors" alt="plot of chunk adding-colors" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Or to color each village in the plot differently, you could use a vector as an input to the argument **`color`**.
Because we are now mapping features of the data to a color, instead of setting one color for all points,
the color now needs to be set inside a call to the **`aes`** function. **`ggplot2`** will provide a different color
corresponding to different values in the vector. 
Here is an example where we color by **`village`**:



~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = village), alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.2, size = 3)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-color-by-village-1.png" title="plot of chunk color-by-village" alt="plot of chunk color-by-village" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

There appears to be a positive trend between number of household
members and number of items owned (from the list provided). This trend
does not appear to be different by village.

You can highlight this aspect of the data by adding a regression line
to the plot. The function `geom_smooth` allows you to add a a variety
of different smoothing functions to the plot. You can choose the type
of smoother to use by setting the `method` argument. Use `method='lm'`
to get a regression line.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = village), alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.2, size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method='lm')
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-regression-line-1.png" title="plot of chunk regression-line" alt="plot of chunk regression-line" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

a good time to save the product of your work.

## Histograms and density plots

While scatterplots are useful when exploring the relationship between two continuous
variables, you may be interested in visualising the distribution of a single variable.
Two plot types commonly used for this purpose are histograms and density plots.

You can create histograms with *ggplot* using `geom_histogram()`. Let's take a look
at the distribution of household size (`no_membrs`).


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs)) +
    geom_histogram()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
~~~
{: .output}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-room-histogram-1.png" title="plot of chunk room-histogram" alt="plot of chunk room-histogram" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That doesn't look great. Histograms count the number of observations in a series of bins
that cover the range of the data. When creating histograms you have to be mindful of 
the effect the chosen bins have on the appearance of the plot. The most important rule 
to keep in mind is that bins should always be of equal size. But even then the
choice of break points can make a big difference. Since you know that there won't be
any fractional household members it makes sense to set the bin width to 1.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-room-histogram-breaks-1.png" title="plot of chunk room-histogram-breaks" alt="plot of chunk room-histogram-breaks" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

That's a bit better but it is difficult to distinguish adjacent bars of the same hight.
That is easily fixed by setting `color = "white"`.



~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth=1, color="white")
~~~
{: .language-r}

Stacked histograms tend to be hard to read. One alternative
is the use of frequency polygons. To switch from histograms to frequency polygons
simply replace `geom_histogram()` with `geom_freqpoly()`



~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, color = village)) +
    geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-room-freqpoly-1.png" title="plot of chunk room-freqpoly" alt="plot of chunk room-freqpoly" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Since the number of responses may differ between villages it can be problematic
to compare absolute counts like this. Instead, it is better to look at densities.
You can create the same plot as above for densities by using `stat(density)`.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, y = stat(density), color = village)) +
    geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-room-freqpoly-density-1.png" title="plot of chunk room-freqpoly-density" alt="plot of chunk room-freqpoly-density" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

You can achieve a similar effect with density plots, using `geom_density()`.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = no_membrs, color = village)) +
    geom_density()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-room-density-1.png" title="plot of chunk room-density" alt="plot of chunk room-density" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This provides a smoothed density estimate that is generally more appropriate
for data that are less discrete.
