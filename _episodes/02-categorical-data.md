We start by loading the required package. **`ggplot2`** is also included in the
**`tidyverse`** package.


~~~
library(tidyverse)
~~~
{: .language-r}

If you don't have the data loaded in your current R session you'll have
to import into R before you can proceed.


~~~
interviews_plotting <- read_csv("data_output/interviews_plotting.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  .default = col_logical(),
  key_ID = col_integer(),
  village = col_character(),
  interview_date = col_datetime(format = ""),
  no_membrs = col_integer(),
  years_liv = col_integer(),
  respondent_wall_type = col_character(),
  rooms = col_integer(),
  memb_assoc = col_character(),
  affect_conflicts = col_character(),
  liv_count = col_integer(),
  items_owned = col_character(),
  no_meals = col_integer(),
  months_lack_food = col_character(),
  instanceID = col_character(),
  number_month_lack_food = col_integer(),
  number_items = col_integer()
)

## Barplots

Barplots are useful for visualizing categorical data. By default,
`geom_bar` accepts a variable for x, and plots the number of times each
value of x (in this case, wall type) appears in the dataset.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-barplot-1-1.png" title="plot of chunk barplot-1" alt="plot of chunk barplot-1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

You can use the `fill` aesthetic for the `geom_bar()` geom to color bars by
the portion of each count that is from each village.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, fill = village)) +
    geom_bar()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-barplot-stack-1.png" title="plot of chunk barplot-stack" alt="plot of chunk barplot-stack" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This creates a stacked bar chart. These are generally more difficult to read
than side-by-side bars. We can separate the portions of the stacked bar that
correspond to each village and put them side-by-side by using the `position`
argument for `geom_bar()` and setting it to "dodge".



~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, fill = village)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-barplot-dodge-1.png" title="plot of chunk barplot-dodge" alt="plot of chunk barplot-dodge" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is a nicer graphic, but what if you're more interested in the
proportion of each housing type in each village than in the actual count of
number of houses of each type. If you don't mind using stacked bars *ggplot*
provides an easy solution using `position = "fill"`.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, fill = village)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-barplot-fill-1.png" title="plot of chunk barplot-fill" alt="plot of chunk barplot-fill" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This creates stacked bars for each wall type with the hight of the different
colored sub-bars corresponding to the proportion of this wall type contributed
by the three villages. Note that this changes the scale of the *y* axis,
which is now showing proportions rather than counts. There is no corresponding
update to the axis label, which may be confusing. You can use the `ylab()` 
function to change that.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, fill = village)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill") + ylab("proportion")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-barplot-ylab-1.png" title="plot of chunk barplot-ylab" alt="plot of chunk barplot-ylab" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

One problem with this plot is that there is no indication how many observations
contributed to each of the bars. A possible way around this issue is to add
the corresponding counts to the plot. This requires you to specify the counts for each group.
These are computed by *ggplot* when creating the plot, but how can you access them
for use in another layer? You can access this information in two different ways.
The first relies on the use of the `stat_*` functions provided by *ggplot*. This family
of functions provides some commonly used computed aesthetics, like the bar hight
for a bar plot. The relevant fuction for this example is `stat_count()`. To 
enable `stat_count()` to add content to your plot you need to tell it how the data
should be represented via the `geom` argument. To get labels you need `geom = "text"`.
The second method is needed when using a computed aesthetic as an argument to `aes()`.
For this purpose *ggplot* provides the `stat()` function, which takes the name of
the required statistic (`count` in this case) as its argument. You also need
to account for the fact that bars are now scaled to fill the height of the
plotting area by telling `stat_count()` to use `position = "fill"`.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, fill = village)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill") + ylab("proportion") +
    stat_count(geom = "text", 
             aes(label = stat(count)),
             position="fill", colour="white")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-barplot-labels-1-1.png" title="plot of chunk barplot-labels-1" alt="plot of chunk barplot-labels-1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This mostly works but the placement of labels at the top end of the bars isn't
ideal. The `vjust` argument allows you to control the vertical positioning of
text labels. Setting this to 0.5 will center the label in the available space. 


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, fill = village)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill") + ylab("proportion") +
    stat_count(geom = "text", 
             aes(label = stat(count)),
             position=position_fill(vjust=0.5), colour="white")

## Boxplot

In an aerlier lesson you've used density plots to examine the differences in the distribution of 
a continuous variable across different levels of a categorical variable. That can work fine for
two or three categories but quickly becomes hard to read. Boxplots are much better suited to visualize
of a variable across several categories. Let's look at a boxplot of the distribution of rooms for each
wall type:


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
    geom_boxplot()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-boxplot-1.png" title="plot of chunk boxplot" alt="plot of chunk boxplot" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is not bad, but because boxplots focus on displaying summary statistics a lot of 
information is lost.

By adding points to a boxplot, we can have a better idea of the number of
measurements and of their distribution:


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.2, color = "tomato")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-boxplot-with-points-1.png" title="plot of chunk boxplot-with-points" alt="plot of chunk boxplot-with-points" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can see that muddaub houses and sunbrick houses tend to be smaller than
burntbrick houses.

Notice how the boxplot layer is behind the jitter layer? What do you need to
change in the code to put the boxplot in front of the points such that it's not
hidden?

In the boxplot you created during the exercise above you used different colored points
to highlight groupings according to a second categorical variable. A better way to
compare these categories is to add more boxes to the plot.


~~~
ggplot(data = interviews_plotting, aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = liv_count, fill = memb_assoc, color = memb_assoc)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 0.1, jitter.height = 0.1))
